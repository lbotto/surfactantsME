# Surfactants for mechanical engineers

 

This book is intended to give an introduction to the topic of surfactant transport in multiphase systems. The target audience is made of mechanical engineering students at the MSc and PhD level.


In contrast to many introductory material on surfactants, these notes assume no knowledge or delve into aspects of physical chemistry. The focus is diffusive and convective transport and effects of interfacial rheology on fluid mechanics.
