# Surfactants for mechanical engineers

 

This book is intended to give an introduction to the topic of surfactant transport in multiphase systems. The target audience is made of mechanical engineering students at the MSc and PhD level.


In contrast to many introductory material on surfactants, these notes assume no knowledge or delve into aspects of physical chemistry. The focus is on diffusive and convective transport of molecular or particulate surfactants by fluid flow, as well as on basic aspects of interfacial rheology relevant to fluid mechanics. The emphasis is on mathematical modelling of surfactants effects, as appropriate for the good background of typical mechanical engineers in mathematical modelling of transport phenomena.

# Structure of the document

The brain of a student learns by iterations. In the first step, the student learns, using mainly physical intuition, the qualitative aspects of a problem and concepts that are simple to understand. This first step also fixes the language, the jargon specific to the discipline. In the second step, more advanced topics can be tackled and mathematics can be used to translate qualitative aspects in equations that enable us to make predictions.

Therefore the book is divided in two.
